      p MESHD is a collaboration application that allows participants to find others to create teams for projects. Once logged in, users can create a profile and find others that may match a need for a project. Participants are prompted to share share skill based, professional, information and images in their profiles and in searching for others. Once collaborations have taken place, participants attest to other's skills and talents through positive testaments and badges. 
        
      p MESHD is an application that came out of Stony Brook University; built and designed between artists, designers, and programmers. Because the application was developed by a diverse group, the MESHD team knows well that great collaboration is often the foundation of amazing projects.
      
      p MESHD is not responsible for collaboration conflicts as teams or partnerships are formed, or after (or whether) work is completed.
      
      p Participants are strongly advised to follow the application recommendation of using the app for sharing skill-based/professional work and information only.
